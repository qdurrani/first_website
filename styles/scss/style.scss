using flexbox to solve page layout issues

https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#aa-examples

The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the
container the ability to alter its itemsâ€™ width/height
(and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate
to all kind of display devices and screen sizes).
A flex container expands items to fill available free space or
shrinks them to prevent overflow.

Note: Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components
of an application, and small-scale layouts, while the Grid
layout is intended for larger scale layouts.
