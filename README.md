### first_website
- This is my first site; it uses HTML + Javascript
- this is branch we are removing CSS and add SASS instead.
- SASS will be automatically compiled into CSS

- mkdir ./styles/css
- mkdir ./styles/scss

- atom editor has a live sass compiler package (SASS Autocomplete) which will
automatically create styles.css from styles.scss whenever styles.scss file is
saved
